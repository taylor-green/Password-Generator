# <Password-Generator>

## Description

Applied JavaScript aspects and fucntions to existing HTML and CSS code to create a random password generator that has the options to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters per the user's choice. When the button "Generate Password" is clicked, the user will receive a series of prompts to answer wherther they would like to inlcude the listed characters. They will also be able to choose the length of the password as long as it is in between 8 and 128 chracters.



## Code and Tech

I utilized VS Code in order to go through and add a script.js file to the existing code to create a fucntioning application.
